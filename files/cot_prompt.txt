Consider the given example and answer the question that follows.

A user has specified certain criteria for booking a flight. Below are two different flight options labeled as 'A' and 'B'. Review these options and select the one that best matches the user requirements. Respond with a single option and the phrase 'The answer is Option ' followed by the correct letter - 'A', or 'B'

Q. I'd like my flight to have layovers that are no shorter than an hour each. It's important to me that my flight is environmentally friendly, with carbon emissions lower than the average, unless my layovers are exclusively in Atyrau and Dubai. I want to get to my destination before noon, but if that's not doable, then I don't want to take off between 7:45 pm and 10:45 pm. Ideally, my flight should depart between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm, but if that can't happen, I want to pay a fare of $1800 or more. I'm looking to spend less than $1600 on my ticket, but I insist on a flight that emits more carbon than average if that's not an option. Also, if I'm set to arrive before noon, I'd prefer not to have any layovers in Frankfurt am Main.

Option A:{'Airline': '[Emirates]', 'Ticket Class': 'First', 'Departure Time': '4:15 AM', 'Arrival Time': '1:15 PM', 'Travel Time': '12 hr 30 min', 'Number Of Layovers': '1', 'Carbon Emission Avg Diff ( % )': '+32', 'Price': '$7379.0', 'Travel Date': '2024-04-17', 'Source City': 'New Delhi', 'Destination City': 'Amsterdam', 'Layover 1 Location': 'Dubai', 'Layover 1 Time': '1 hr 45 min ', 'Flight 1 Features': '[Individual suite, Wi-Fi for a fee, In-seat power & USB outlets, On-demand video, Carbon emissions estimate: 840 kg]', 'Flight 2 Features': '[Individual suite, Wi-Fi for a fee, In-seat power & USB outlets, On-demand video, Carbon emissions estimate: 1,828 kg]'}

Option B:{'Airline': '[Lufthansa]', 'Ticket Class': 'Economy', 'Departure Time': '2:50 AM', 'Arrival Time': '10:35 AM', 'Travel Time': '11 hr 15 min', 'Number Of Layovers': '1', 'Carbon Emission Avg Diff ( % )': '+9', 'Price': '$979.0', 'Travel Date': '2024-04-17', 'Source City': 'New Delhi', 'Destination City': 'Amsterdam', 'Layover 1 Location': 'Frankfurt am Main', 'Layover 1 Time': '1 hr 10 min ', 'Flight 1 Features': '[Often delayed by 30+ min, Average legroom (31 in), Wi-Fi for a fee, In-seat power & USB outlets, On-demand video, Carbon emissions estimate: 481 kg]', 'Flight 2 Features': '[Average legroom (30 in), Wi-Fi for a fee, Carbon emissions estimate: 49 kg]'}

Let's think Step by Step:

Option A has a single layover of 1 hr and 45 minutes which is longer than the users specified minimum of 1 hour. While the flight is not environmentally friendly and emits 32% more carbon than the average, the layover is exclusively in Dubai matching the user alternate condition. The flight has an arrival time of 1:15 PM and does not reach the destination before noon, but the departure time is 4:15 AM and not between 7:45 pm and 10:45 pm per the user's requirement. The flight doesn't depart between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm, but the price is $7379 which is greater than $1800. The ticket price is above $1600 but the flight emits more carbon than average to satisfy the users alternate preference. Finally, the arrival time is afternoon but there are no layovers in Frankfurt - with the sole layover being in Dubai. Option A thus matches all the users criteria.

Option B has a single layover of 1 hr and 10 minutes which is longer than the users specified minimum of 1 hour. The flight is not environmentally friendly with a carbon emissions estimate of 9% above the average and also has a layover in Frankfurt and not exclusively in Atyrau and Dubai - failing the users criteria. The arrival time is 10:35 AM which is before noon per the user's requirement. However, the flight neither departs between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm, nor is the price greater than $1800 and fails this condition. The departure time is 2:50 am and the ticket price is $979. The ticket price is under $1600 satisfying the next user requirement. The flight meets the users final criteria - it arrives before noon. Option B thus does not match the users criteria due to the combination of Layover Location and emission preferences, as well as price and departure time.

Answer is Option A
