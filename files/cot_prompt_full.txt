Review these options and select the one that best matches the user requirements. Respond with a single option and the phrase 'The answer is Option ' followed by the correct letter - 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'E'.

Q. I'd like my flight to have layovers that are no shorter than an hour each. It's important to me that my flight is environmentally friendly, with carbon emissions lower than the average, unless my layovers are exclusively in Atyrau and Dubai. I want to get to my destination before noon, but if that's not doable, then I don't want to take off between 7:45 pm and 10:45 pm. Ideally, my flight should depart between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm, but if that can't happen, I want to pay a fare of $1800 or more. I'm looking to spend less than $1600 on my ticket, but I insist on a flight that emits more carbon than average if that's not an option. Also, if I'm set to arrive before noon, I'd prefer not to have any layovers in Frankfurt am Main.

Let's think Step by Step:

Option A has a single layover of 1 hr which meets the users specified criteria of layovers being a minimum of 1 hour. The flight is environmentally friendly and emits 14% less carbon than the average, meeting the users next condition of below average carbon emissions or layovers only in Atyrau and Dubai. The flight has an arrival time of 9:00 AM and departs at 1:10 AM satisfying both conditions of the next criteria of either arriving before noon or not departing between 7:45 pm and 10:45 pm. However, since the departure is at 1:10 am and the fare is only $846 the users next requirement, which specifies a departure time between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm or a ticket price of $1800 or more, is not met. Since the ticket price is $846, the next requirement of the price being under $1600 or carbon emissions being above average is satisfied. The user's last condition is that if the arrival time is before noon, no layover should be in Frankfurt am Main - this is satisfied as the arrival time is before noon but the only layover is in Zurich and not Frankfurt. Option A does not match the user criteria due to the combination of ticket price being under $1800 and departure time not between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm.

Option B has a single layover of 1 hr and 45 minutes which is longer than the users specified minimum of 1 hour. The flight is environmentally friendly and emits 22% less carbon than the average, satisfying the users requirement of below average emissions or layovers that are limited to either Dubai or Atyrau. The flight has an arrival time of 5:35 PM and departs at 7:40 AM which does not satisfy the requirement of arriving before noon but satisfies the user's alternate condition of not departing between 7:45 pm and 10:45 pm. The flight doesn't depart between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm, and the price is $618 which is less than $1800 - violating the user's condition. The ticket price is under $1600 meeting the next condition despite emissions that are not greater than average. Also, the arrival time is at 5:35 pm - meeting the final condition of arriving after 12 noon or avoiding any layovers in Frankfurt. Option B, however, does not match the user criteria due to the combination of ticket price being under $1800 and departure time not between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm.

Option C has 2 layovers of 29 hr 55 minutes and 7 hr respectively - both of which are longer than the users specified minimum of 1 hour. The flight is not environmentally friendly and emits 22% more carbon than the average, and the layovers are in Almaty and Atyrau - violating the condition that carbon emissions should be below average or all layovers should be in either Dubai or Atyrau. The flight has an arrival time of 10:00 AM and departs at 11:35 AM which satisfies both alternatives of the next condition - either arriving before noon or not departing between 7:45 pm and 10:45 pm. The flight doesn't depart between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm, and the price is $686 which is less than $1800 - violating the user's condition as well. The ticket price is under $1600 and carbon emissions are above average, so the next criteria is satisfied. The arrival time is 10:00 AM which is before noon but the layovers are in Almaty and Atyrau, and not in Frankfurt, thus meeting the final condition. Option C, however, does not match the user criteria as it fails two conditions.

Option D has a single layover of 1 hr and 45 minutes which is longer than the users specified minimum of 1 hour. While the flight is not environmentally friendly and emits 32% more carbon than the average, the layover is exclusively in Dubai matching the user alternate condition. The flight has an arrival time of 1:15 PM and does not reach the destination before noon, but the departure time is 4:15 AM and not between 7:45 pm and 10:45 pm per the user's requirement. The flight doesn't depart between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm, but the price is $7379 which is greater than $1800. The ticket price is above $1600 but the flight emits more carbon than average to satisfy the users alternate preference. Finally, the arrival time is afternoon but there are no layovers in Frankfurt - with the sole layover being in Dubai. Option A thus matches all the users criteria.

Option E has a single layover of 1 hr and 10 minutes which is longer than the users specified minimum of 1 hour. The flight is not environmentally friendly with a carbon emissions estimate of 9% above the average and also has a layover in Frankfurt and not exclusively in Atyrau and Dubai - failing the users criteria. The arrival time is 10:35 AM which is before noon per the user's requirement. However, the flight neither departs between 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm, nor is the price greater than $1800 and fails this condition. The departure time is 2:50 am and the ticket price is $979. The ticket price is under $1600 satisfying the next user requirement. The flight meets the users final criteria - it arrives before noon. Option B thus does not match the users criteria due to the combination of Layover Location and emission preferences, as well as price and departure time.

Answer is Option D

A user has specified certain criteria for booking a flight. Below are five different flight options labeled as 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E'. Review these options and select the one that best matches the user requirements. Respond with a single option and the phrase 'The answer is Option ' followed by the correct letter - 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'E'
